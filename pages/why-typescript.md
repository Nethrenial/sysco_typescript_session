# Why TypeScript?

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language. It is a powerful tool that helps you write safer and more predictable code. Here are some reasons why you should consider using TypeScript:

- **Type safety**: TypeScript helps you catch errors at compile time rather than at runtime. This can save you a lot of time and effort debugging your code.

- **Code completion**: TypeScript provides intelligent code completion that helps you write code faster and with fewer errors.

- **Refactoring**: TypeScript makes it easier to refactor your code by providing tools that help you rename symbols, extract code into functions, and more.

- **Documentation**: TypeScript's type annotations serve as documentation for your code, making it easier for other developers (and your future self) to understand how your code works.

- **Tooling**: TypeScript integrates with popular editors like Visual Studio Code, providing features like code navigation, refactoring, and debugging.

- **Community**: TypeScript has a large and active community that provides support, tools, and libraries to help you get the most out of the language.
